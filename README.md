**Date:** 20/11/2025

**Reg. No.:** 212223080057


## **Aim**

To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.

## **Tools Required**

* ChatGPT (GPT-5) / Google Gemini / Microsoft Copilot
* Internet connection
* Text editor or markdown platform (for documentation)

## **Procedure**

### **1. Understanding Prompt Patterns**

Several prompt engineering patterns are mentioned:

| Prompt Pattern          | Description                                     | Purpose                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
|   Query Decomposition   | Breaking complex tasks into smaller queries     | Improves accuracy and focus                              |
|   Decision Making       | Asking AI to choose between multiple options    | Helps refine direction and content flow                  |
|   Answer Engineering    | Instructing structure and style of response     | Ensures consistency and clarity                          |
|   Fact Checklist        | Prompting AI to verify factual accuracy         | Enhances reliability for reports                         |
|   Tail Generation       | Extending narrative or analysis logically       | Adds depth and continuity                                |
|   Menu Actions          | Offering the AI multiple choices to select from | Increases creative control                               |
|   Semantic Filtering    | Applying style or tone filters                  | Ensures tone consistency (formal, educational, creative) |

### **2. Choosing Content Types**

Two types of content were selected from the list of suggested scenarios:

1. **Business Report on Market Trends** (Formal + Analytical)
2. **Creative Writing: Sci-Fi Short Story** (Narrative + Imaginative)

These represent two opposite genres — analytical vs. creative — allowing a clear observation of how prompt structures adapt to purpose.

---

### **3. Prompting Process**

#### **Scenario 1 – Business Report on Market Trends**

**Step 1 – Simple Prompt**

> “Write a short report on current global market trends.”

**Output Summary:**

* Basic overview of markets (technology, energy, finance).
* Lacked structure, statistics, and sectioning.
* Tone: general and brief.

---

**Step 2 – Using Query Decomposition & Answer Engineering**

> “Generate a structured business report on global market trends.
> Divide it into Introduction, Key Sectors, Emerging Markets, Challenges, and Conclusion.
> Use analytical language with formal tone.”

**Output Summary:**

* Clear sectioning with professional formatting.
* Introduced subsectors (AI, renewable energy, digital finance).
* Tone improved; flow became logical.

---

**Step 3 – Using Semantic Filtering & Fact Checklist**

> “Revise the above report to maintain a professional and data-driven tone.
> Include approximate data trends (e.g., global growth percentages) and mention key global events influencing markets.
> Ensure the information aligns with 2025 projections.”

**Output Summary:**

* Integrated realistic data:
  *AI market growth at ~20% CAGR; renewable energy investments up 30%.*
* Tone: formal, polished, and executive-level.
* Structure matched corporate reporting standards.

---

**🧾 Final Refined Business Report Output:**

> ### **Global Market Trends Report – 2025**
>

> * **Renewable Energy:** Solar and wind markets see 30% investment growth due to sustainability policies.
> * **FinTech:** Digital payments dominate 75% of transactions globally.
>
> **Emerging Markets:**
> South-East Asia and Africa show rising digital economies supported by government tech investments.
>
> **Challenges:**
> Inflation pressures and data privacy laws slow down expansion in developed markets.
>
> **Conclusion:**
> The balance between technological acceleration and sustainability goals will define the market trajectory through 2030.

---

#### **Scenario 2 – Creative Writing: Sci-Fi Short Story**

**Step 1 – Simple Prompt**

> “Write a short sci-fi story about a robot.”

**Output Summary:**

* Basic story of a robot exploring a planet.
* Short, generic, no emotional depth or world-building.

---

**Step 2 – Using Tail Generation & Decision Making**

> “Create a 300-word sci-fi story about a robot exploring a dying Earth.
> Choose between two tones: hopeful or tragic.
> Select one and justify the choice in the story’s ending.”

**Output Summary:**

* AI selected *hopeful tone*.
* Story introduced emotional conflict and goal (restoring life).
* Included vivid details and smoother narrative arc.

---

**Step 3 – Using Semantic Filtering (Creative Style)**

> “Refine the story using cinematic narration and descriptive imagery.
> Maintain hopeful tone and poetic language. Add dialogue for emotional depth.”

**🧠 Final Refined Sci-Fi Story Output:**

> ### **“The Last Seed”**
>
> In the silent ruins of Earth, the robot *EON-7* wandered through dust storms carrying a glass vial — the last seed of life.
>
> “All systems fading,” its voice crackled. Yet it pressed on, past fallen cities and shattered satellites glowing in the crimson dusk.
>
> Upon reaching a valley once called Eden, it dug into the soil — brittle, grey, and cold. EON-7 whispered the activation code, releasing a pulse of nanobots into the ground.
>
> Minutes later, a single green sprout emerged, reflecting on its metallic shell.
>
> “Mission complete,” EON-7 murmured as its energy drained.
>
> When dawn broke, the valley shimmered with light — the Earth had begun to breathe again.

## **5. Discussion**

This experiment demonstrates how **prompt sophistication directly influences content quality**:

* Simple prompts produce generic results.
* Structured prompts using decomposition or filtering yield logical and stylistically consistent outputs.
* Creative tasks benefit from decision-making and tail generation, while analytical tasks improve with answer engineering and fact-checking.

AI tools like ChatGPT respond best when **context, role, and format are specified** clearly.

## **Conclusion**

By applying prompt patterns such as decomposition, decision-making, and semantic filtering, AI-generated content becomes more structured, accurate, and expressive.
This experiment confirms that the design of a prompt is as critical as the model itself — determining the tone, coherence, and creativity of the output.
Whether creating formal business reports or imaginative stories, prompt engineering provides control, precision, and personalization in AI-assisted content creation.

## **Result**

Thus, the experiment successfully demonstrated how prompt engineering patterns influence the generation of diverse content types - from analytical reports to creative narratives - proving that well-structured prompts lead to superior and contextually rich outputs.
